<H1 align=center>Mortgage lending curbs to impact first-home buyers</H1>
<br><br>
<img class="img4" align="middle" src="news4.jpg">
<p class="content">With the federal treasurer confirming that macroprudential curbs to mortgage lending are on the cards, it appears to no longer be a matter of if, just when, policy will be introduced.<br><br>

The Council of Financial Regulators on Wednesday noted they have been in discussions about possible macroprudential policy responses. They also noted that over the next couple of months, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority also plans to publish an information paper on its framework for implementing macroprudential policy. <br><br>

The last time lending restrictions were implemented, the focus was on dampening the heightened investment in the property market and excessive use of interest-only mortgages.<br><br>

However, the main culprit for the looming round of lending restrictions appears to be the increasing share of loans on a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. Almost a quarter (22%) of new mortgages in Australia now have debt that outweighs their income by more than six times, up from 16% a year ago. <br><br>

The introduction of macroprudential policies, particularly those around debt to income, will have limited impact on higher wealth households, particularly those with multiple income streams. It will, however, most adversely affect lower-income households and those purchasing property for the first time.   <br><br>

There are several reasons the DTI ratio has risen over the past year. <br><br>

First, low interest rates by their very nature allow people to service more debt as repayments fall. Lower interest rates have been a key driver of property price growth over the past two years and the number of high-debt borrowers has naturally increased as more people can afford larger mortgages.  <br><br>

Second, the share of lending to first-home buyers has increased significantly on the back of HomeBuilder, the federal governmentâ€™s First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, and individual state government incentives.
